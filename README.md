## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this IP Address Tracker app and get it looking as close to the design as possible. To get the IP Address locations, I'll be using the [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/). To generate the map, I have used [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Build with:

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vue 3
- Composition API
- LeafletJS
